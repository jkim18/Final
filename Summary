When I first came up with this idea for the final, I searched for some other people who have done what I had in mind and tried
to come up with an idea of what I wanted to have. 

As I started with the project, I realized how complicated and ambitious my original idea would have been, because simply 
getting the code to draw rectangles when a note was pressed was complicated and confusing enough for me. I am happy with the
end result because it seemed like everyone else seemed to enjoy it, but I do wish I had more time (and more knowledge) to 
go further with it. I did want to add effects such as making the rectangles fade away as they fell and placing them to be drawn
so that the black keys would be higher than the white ones.

I think what the most difficult thing for me was to get familiar with the language. Programming was already confusing for me as
it was, but adding the language that comes with the MidiBus was also quite challenging.
